Hey Angel! So how do you like your progress so far, and what would you say to someone who is nervous?

00:05.500 --> 00:13
Uh, my progress has been great. I have learned a lot of moves, thanks to the coaches here. Especially Natalie, she's really good.

00:13 --> 00:23
And for someone new, I would say like: Try to do it as soon as you can. It's gonna be useful in more ways than you think about it.

00:23 --> 00:28.500
It's also healthy. And you'll have fun!
Thank you!
